# Personal Website, HTML and CSS
Catherine Xie

his repository contains the code for my personal website, built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. The website features a cover image, overlaid with text introducing myself and my background as a computer science student at CU Boulder.

In addition to HTML and CSS, I have experience with C++ and Python and have created several projects that can be found on my GitHub profile. I'm also proficient in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, allowing me to bring a unique combination of design and coding skills to any project.

Feel free to take a look at the code or visit the live site to learn more about me and my work.
